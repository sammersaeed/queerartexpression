<h1>What is Queer Art?</h1>
    <p class="font">Before we get to the more artsy part. What is queer art actually considered, you may ask? I would say anything made by a queer artist or presents queer ideas/views. Some may argue, that just because an artist is queer, it doesn’t make all of their work queer pieces also. But in my mind, being queer is part of who you are and how you express yourself, not something you can easily hide away especially when making personal art. This definition like many others in my research is up to personal interpretation.</p>

<h1>The Art of a Word</h1>


    <p class="font"> The obvious first example of expression here is the word “queer” itself. For so long, being queer was considered a horrible thing, some “sin” where there was no going back, still not even totally acceptable now. Being called queer was the same as being called a slur because it was a slur. Which isn’t surprising because oppressors have a slur for every minority. The official definition of queer is “differing in some way from what is usual or normal: odd, strange, or weird.”(Source #1) After so many decades, it gives me great pleasure to say the queer community has reclaimed that word, not as a half-hearted acceptance, but as a rallying, powerful, and prideful word. We may be a minority, but at least we are a united one. One of the best parts is the amount of variance of identities under this term. Questioning people, those who don’t feel comfortable with their label yet can use the term queer without feeling pressured. (Source #2) Although no one should feel pressured to “pick” a label, the world we live in doesn’t really support people just living comfortably with themselves. </p>
    <p class="font"> There are definitely some other words that many queer/LGBTQ+ people use, that I just could not accept coming from anyone outside of the community. To be obvious, words have different meanings coming from different people. Many of them are a little vulgar, so adult supervision is advised. If a straight white cis-gendered person calls me a “b****,” then there will be a problem. If anyone from a minority community calls me the “b-word,” I would not be angry. Here is the kicker, when a queer person calls me that, my life is complete, and that is the best compliment I will ever receive in my entire existence. There is just this secret universal code or internal acceptance of the true meaning of a word, that feels like it comes naturally, an unspoken connection if you will. That is one of many beauties people in the queer community will find.  </p>
    <p class="font">Some cis-gendered straight people try to make themselves more “seen” in this wonderful community, or at least grab a little more attention. Why would they need even more attention after centuries of being the majority? I could not tell you. Something we can compare this to for better understanding is the existence of “white pride” groups. Have you ever heard of a white pride group that wasn’t racist? (Source #3) If you have, then that’s a first for me. Minority after minority have to fight to stay unique in the eyes of others while still getting hate. The community would not let this once derogatory word slip away. It is their term and the self-expression that they have claimed, no one else can take that.</p>


<h1>The Purposes</h1>
    <p class="font">The purpose of any art is based on the artist. Were they paid to paint this, perform this, and draw that? Perhaps. Were they having a hard day and needed some way to vent? Also a possibility. The two purposes most prevalent are to show unity and to “stick it to the man,” so to speak. </p>

    <h3>To Show Unity</h3>

    <p class="font">All minorities tend to stick together because there is strength in numbers, or because we are tired of being the odd ones out. The overall mental stability of this community, as of most minority communities, is almost entirely stabilized by interacting and intersecting with those in the community. No one can truly be as strong as they could be when alone. One of the hardest things that hit the queer community is the sexually transmitted disease outbreaks. The most moving and meaningful piece of art during the 20th century was in response to the AIDS epidemic. The NAMES Project created an AIDS Memorial Quilt, over seventeen acres of documented names of more than 82,000 people who died because of the epidemic. (Source #4) Being one of the largest pieces of community art in the world shows how united the queer community is. There is still so much hate received because of the AIDS epidemic. While fighting that, the community managed to honor those they lost. Once again, leading back to community wellness by allowing them to grieve in a healthy and respectful way.
    </p>
    <p class="font">On a more personal note, I will share the background of one of my own “coming out” stories. Two of my best friends are queer, did I know that when I met them? Not at all. I have known one of them for over a decade and didn’t find out they were queer until a year ago. That was mostly because we grew up in a religiously conservative community. I find it amazing how we, probably two of the few queers that came out of that city (pun intended) managed to click with each other at such a young age. Anyways, enough about the unimportant backstory details. Today we joke about how “obviously” queer we were. We literally met tap dancing in the hallway. Then those two young “girls,” started making our own ballroom dances, I, the non-binary person, was of course the “male lead.” Were those years of dancing trying to express our “gayness” for nothing? Not at all, I proposed to her at the tender age of 12 years old, and we got “married” under the playground slide. Still have not gotten a divorce, but oh well. Although we do not like romantically like each other, the idea that we could married if we did, or really the possibility of even being queer, gave us a little hope. I believe it greatly contributed to our mental wellness today because the acceptance we had of our dances was the first step.
    </p>

    <h3>To Fight Oppressors</h3>

    <p class="font">Another purpose is to fight against oppressors. One of my favorite paintings is “Two Nudes in the Forest (1939)” by Frida Kahlo, shown on the “Introduction” page. Even though women are the majority of most nude paintings, I truly believe the cis-gendered straight men will have a difficult time sexualizing the pure sensuality shown in the painting. It just feels too raw for someone to misinterpret, but I could be sorely mistaken considering the amount of homophobia still in this world.</p>
    <p class="font">There are also more general ways to fight against oppressors, and one of those is defacing stereotypes. Finding the cause of a stereotype, if the statistics are true, can be a great way to deface it without changing yourself. I have seen multiple of my friends either do everything that a queer person “would do” or do nothing a queer person “would do.” Changing yourself just to deny the stereotype isn’t the answer. It contributes to harming personal wellness, which leads to decline in the community as a whole. For example, there is a stereotype that queer people, especially queer men, are more artistic than their straight counterparts. When in reality, they are just more open to derail from the societal norm of female dominant activities, which straight men would also be more involved in if these rules did not exist in the first place. (Source #5) They then have to hide their artistic ability and interest which could be a large part of their inner personality, which could lead to less queer art in general. Society has caused so much to be changed in people, when everyone should just do as they artistically please, without hurting anyone of course.</p>
    <p class="font">The more basic ways could include drawing attention to our community, like drawing pride art on the wall. Or even just placing your pride flag outside of your residence, if allowed of  course. The little things add up, once again, because there is strength in numbers. We can see small feats like that right here in Ann Arbor. When I go on bike rides, I never feel out of place because no matter what street I am on there is always some form of queer art. My personal favorite is the entire co-op house dedicated to non-binary people, called “minnie’s” on State street. The house is paint purple, a color incoporated in the non-binary pride flag, and there are multiple pieces of art or flags outside that represent the same flag. The best part is that it is by a Michigan house, which is entirely maize and blue. To me, that shows support and I am very grateful for it.</p>

<h1>My Personal Purpose</h1>
    <p class="font">When attempting to brainstorm a final project idea, my immediate focus was the transgender community, but part of me felt like that was something I could do justice to. I do identify as transgender, specifically non-binary, but I am too cis-passing to have any extreme hardships caused by it. I thought of the LGBTQ+ community as a whole after that, but that still wasn’t broad enough because I have multiple labels within that. So, queer was my final decision. The idea of art came to me as I was reading "Making Gold Out of It: rupi kaur's Poem, Pain, and Phantasmagoria" by L. Ayu Saraswati. (Source #5) Saraswati says that the pain in Rupi Kaur’s poems can amplify a voice as a form of protest. Rubi also admits that the pain in her poem is not just her own, which I think can really relate to the queer community as a whole.  One of my poems specifically is about my personal struggle with gender dysphoria. My original reason for writing it was because a friend of a friend has been struggling with it also, but they aren’t familiar with the accepting community yet. It was a way I could show my personal pain and respect the same pain so many others feel. A method of communicating that they aren’t alone in this journey. That showed me how true pain and oppression can be represented through art, and as a self-proclaimed artist myself, I couldn’t help but feel connected to it. The poems I included on this website are not my typical form of artwork. I usually paint or build, I was actually a home renovator with my Dad for a few years, which can be a topic for various Lesbian jokes. I assumed that many world-renowned artists didn’t feel comfortable expressing some part of themselves, so I should try something new, that didn’t involve getting my hands dirty. Which I enjoyed a fair amount.  </p>
    <p class="font">The website as a whole is art to me. I created it to express the way I felt, about the expression of others, a bit ironic, but meaningful. Website design is an art, many graphic designers specialize in this field because it can be easier to be subtle with some things. Although my website isn’t very subtle because I used pride colors to create a welcoming environment for those who wish to learn more and to ward off the evils that are the homophobes trying to gain intel. I also use humor as a form of expression, I am sure you could tell by the end.</p>
