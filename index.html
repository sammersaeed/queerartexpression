    <p class="font">This project is intended to dive into the world of queer and LGBTQ+ art. The most focused point will be the purpose of the art. What is the purpose of making queer art? What are the effects of different types of art? How does the effect fight against oppressors? Fighting oppressors and showing strength are the main purposes of queer art, which is my thesis. </p>

    <p class="font"> Each page includes the work of a famous artist and their story. There are also gallery and poetry pages including some of my artwork, Sammer Saeed, and the work of friends. Each page also includes a song in the background by different queer musicians. I purposely included songs that are overly “gay” or stereotypically most queer people would know. </p>
